# Plane classification project

Development of a basic neural network to identify type of plane on images.

Then deployement of a streamlit app that allows to test for the identification.

The app can be access [here](https://share.streamlit.io/bgtm/plane_classification/main/app/app.py)

**Note** : A SVM has also been trained but only on very few images, thus this classifier is very poor.
